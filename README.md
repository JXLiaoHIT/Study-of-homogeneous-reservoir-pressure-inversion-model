# Study-of-homogeneous-reservoir-pressure-inversion-model
This is the data from the homogeneous stratigraphic Gringarten-Bourdet curves of paper "Study of homogeneous reservoir pressure inversion model  based on permeability mechanics and interpretation software design" 

Each 'CdS*.csv' file corresponds to a set of curves with the dimensionless pressure and the dimensionless pressure derivative. The first column of the table is the pressure and the second column is the pressure derivative. 't.csv' and 'td.csv' are the time of pressure and the time of pressure derivative respectively.
